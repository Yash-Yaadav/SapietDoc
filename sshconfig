# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# If you want to change the port on a SELinux system, you have to tell
# SELinux about this change.

# System-wide Crypto policy:
# This system is following system-wide crypto policy. The changes to
# Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgoritms and GSSAPIKexAlgorithsm will not have any
# effect here. They will be overridden by command-line options passed on
# the server start up.
# To opt out, uncomment a line with redefinition of  CRYPTO_POLICY=
# variable in  /etc/sysconfig/sshd  to overwrite the policy.
# For more information, see manual page for update-crypto-policies(8).
